What is the class of the vector? class()
What type of variable does it store? typeof()
Access the 3rd element and store as vec_1_e3
Access the 1st element and store as vec_1_e1
Access the 5th through 7th elements and store as vec_1_e5to7
Reassign vec_1 as a character using as.character, stored as vec_1_char. What does the output look like?
```{r}
vec_1 <- c(2, 5, 9, 10, 8, 12, 1, 0)
class(vec_1) #numeric
typeof(vec_1) #double

vec_1_e3 <- vec_1[3]
vec_1_e3

vec_1_e1 <- vec_1[1]

vec_1_e5to7 <- vec_1[5:7]
vec_1_e5to7

vec_1_char <- as.character(vec_1)
vec_1_char #everything is in quotation marks
```
